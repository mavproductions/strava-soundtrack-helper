# (NEEDS SERIOUS REWORK. PROJECT ON-HOLD)

## strava-soundtrack-helper
With the use of Strava GPX and Last.FM scrobble history, you can make your own music map and share your music listening history from your workout!

Inside the app will give you tips with the manual work required inside Adobe Photoshop or GIMP to make your own privacy zones of your music map.

### Offsets
With offset timing, it is app-dependent. With tests from [Panscrobbler for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arn.scrobble&hl=en&gl=US), I get pinpoint accuracy for GPS scrobbles, where as [Last.FM's Spotify Scrobbling](https://www.last.fm/settings/applications), it appears to require subtract offset timing.
